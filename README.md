📊 Dataset

This project uses the publicly available Music Genre Dataset from Kaggle.

License: CC0 – Public Domain

Dataset link: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/vicsuperman/prediction-of-music-genre

🧠 Methods & Tools Used

Programming: Python

Libraries: scikit-learn, NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Plotly, SciPy

Techniques Used:

Decision Tree Classification

K-Means Clustering

Recursive Feature Elimination (RFE)

Feature importance analysis

Trend visualization of key audio features

🎯 Key Findings

Features such as loudness, energy, and spectral characteristics strongly influenced genre classification.

RFE improved model interpretability by narrowing down the most impactful predictors.

Both supervised and unsupervised methods revealed meaningful structure in the dataset.

Results and visualizations are fully documented in the report.
