## 📊 Dataset

This project uses the publicly available Music Genre Dataset from Kaggle.

Dataset link: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/vicsuperman/prediction-of-music-genre

## 🧠 Methods & Tools Used

Programming: Python

Libraries: scikit-learn, NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Plotly, SciPy

Techniques Used:

- Decision Tree Classification

- K-Means Clustering

- Recursive Feature Elimination (RFE)

- Feature importance analysis

- Trend visualization of key audio features

## 🎯 Key Findings

- Features such as loudness, energy, and spectral characteristics strongly influenced genre classification.

- RFE improved model interpretability by narrowing down the most impactful predictors.

- Both supervised and unsupervised methods revealed meaningful structure in the dataset.

- Results and visualizations are fully documented in the report.

## My Contributions
This project was completed as part of a 3-person team for a course at the University of Washington. 
My individual contributions included:
- Building the machine learning pipeline in Python using Decision Trees  
- Running feature selection with RFE and performing statistical analysis  
- Creating data visualizations and preparing part of the final report
